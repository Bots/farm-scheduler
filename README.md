Twitter Appointment Scheduler
Description

Twitter Appointment Scheduler is a Python script that monitors Twitter for tweets containing a specific hashtag. Upon detecting a tweet with the designated hashtag, the script schedules an appointment for viewing. This tool is ideal for professionals who wish to automate their scheduling process based on social media interactions or for anyone interested in creating events triggered by social media activity.
Features

Before you run the script, make sure you have the following requirements installed:

    Python 3.x
    Tweepy (A Python library for accessing the Twitter API)
    A Twitter Developer account and API credentials
    Any additional libraries or tools required for scheduling (e.g., Google Calendar API client if integrating with Google Calendar)

Installation

    Clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.
    Navigate to the script's directory in your terminal.
    Install the required Python dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Rename the config_sample.py to config.py and fill in your Twitter API credentials and the desired hashtag.

Configuration

Before running the script, you need to configure it. Open the config.py file and set the following variables:

    CONSUMER_KEY: Your Twitter API consumer key
    CONSUMER_SECRET: Your Twitter API consumer secret
    ACCESS_TOKEN: Your Twitter API access token
    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: Your Twitter API access token secret
