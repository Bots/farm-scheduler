Farm Scheduler
Description

Farm Scheduler is a Python application that monitors Twitter for tweets containing a specified hashtag. When a tweet with the targeted hashtag is detected, the application schedules an appointment in Google Calendar for the event mentioned in the tweet. This tool provides an innovative way for farm event organizers to automate their event scheduling process based on social media interactions.

    A Twitter Developer account and API credentials
    Google Calendar API client library
    OAuth 2.0 credentials for Google Calendar API

Installation

Follow these steps to install Farm Scheduler:

    Clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.
    Open your terminal and navigate to the script's directory.
    Install the required Python dependencies using pip:

    bash

    Rename config_sample.py to config.py and populate it with your Twitter API credentials, Google Calendar API credentials, and the desired hashtag.
